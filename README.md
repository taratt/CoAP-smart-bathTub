# CoAP-smart-bathTub
This project is an IoT system that could be used as a smart bathtub with features such as water level and temperature configurations for individuals using hardware parts such as NodeMCU (ESP8266), water level and temperature sensors and RFID.
This implementation uses CoAP as application layer protocol.
